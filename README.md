# AllCats by Anna :heart_eyes_cat::yellow_heart:

Tech challenge for allplants! :seedling:
A small fictional cat adoption site.

You can see the site live at https://annas-allcats.netlify.com/ :cat:
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5ddbc4f6-e801-4fab-a346-ad5532fecea8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/annas-allcats/deploys)

## How to run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

After cloning the repo, in the project directory, run `npm i` to install dependencies.
Then run _`yarn start` or `npm start`_
to run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## How it was done

I spent approximately 4 hours on the challenge (with a lunch & a cinema break).

## To do

- even though I followed a mobile-first approach throughout most of the project, I started with the desktop naviagtion and did not have time to finish the hamburger menu for the mobile version
- tests!!
- 'Take me home' buttons should explode in a heart, currently they do not do anything
- polish the design! (there are still spacing issues here and there)
- revisit the cat tiles and figure out a better way of sizing them (right now the list width and the images are set in pixels which is not the most accessible)
- add a loading state (there are really nice easy-to-use libraries with simple designs, I have used react-content-loader before which was a delight)

Thank you for checking out my AllCats :sparkles:
